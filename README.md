# HackerRank

A collection of hackerrank solutions to the Cracking the Coding Interview Challenges.

Note: These are just sample solutions, they are by no means the one and only optimal solution.
In many cases the solution could be made more fficient (either in time or space complexity), but 
for interpretability solutions have been kept as clean as possible. 

Comments are also sparse in the code, if you have a question feel free to open an issue and I will
get back to you ASAP
